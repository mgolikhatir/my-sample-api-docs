# 🚀 My Sample .NET REST API Documentation

This repository contains the full documentation for a sample RESTful API project built with **.NET**. The primary purpose of this project is to showcase clean, well-structured API design and to provide a clear example of how to implement the **OpenAPI (Swagger)** specification.

### 📝 About the API
This sample API demonstrates key backend development principles, including:
- **RESTful Design:** Adhering to standard HTTP methods for resource-based operations.
